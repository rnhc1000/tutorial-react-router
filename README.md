## React Router DOM + TypeScript + Vite

### WARNING: 
- These are the steps I took to complete the original React-Router-DOM tutorial as available at
[https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/tutorial], guided by @devsuperior.
Check the commit logs to learn the solution for every step taken.

React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router runs anywhere React runs; on the web, on the server with node.js, and on React Native.

If you're just getting started with React generally, we recommend you follow the excellent Getting Started guide in the official docs. There is plenty of information there to get you up and running. React Router is compatible with React >= 16.8.

We'll keep this tutorial quick and to the point. By the end you'll know the APIs you deal with day-to-day with React Router. After that, you can dig into some of the other docs to get a deeper understanding.
